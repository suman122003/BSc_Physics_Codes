## Practicals [file](CC09_Modern_Physics_Practicals.ipynb)
Practical name: I-V Chracteristics of a Tunneling Diode. Here the curve fitting was unsuccessful (using `curve_fit` in `scipy.optimize`, `polyfit` in numpy and user defined polynomial fit function).

## Radioactive Decay [file](Radioactive_Decay_SKP.ipynb)
The decay with time is shown both analytically and numerically (with graphs). Successive decay is also shown here. For analytical solutions, SymPy is used here.
