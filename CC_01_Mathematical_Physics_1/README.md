## Partial Derivatives (SKP) [file](Partial_Derivatives_SKP.ipynb)
This is a Python program that uses the sympy library to perform various operations on 2D and 3D functions; including finding partial derivatives, extrema, and solving optimization problems using the Lagrange multipliers method.

- The chain rule
- Maxima and minima of a 2D function
- Lagrange multipliers

## Vectors (SKP) [file](Vectors_SKP.ipynb)

In this notebook, vector operations in sympy and numpy are covered. Here, we will start by defining some vectors and then perform various operations on them, such as dot product, cross product, length, projection, and lines. Finally, we will solve an example problem involving finding the unit vector parallel to the line of intersection of two planes.

We can define vectors in sympy using the `Matrix` class. In numpy we can use numpy arrays to perform vector operations.

- Vector products
- Length of a vector
- Vector projection
- Lines
- Planes
