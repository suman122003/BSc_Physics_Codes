## Differential Equation Solver [file](Differential_Equation_Solver_SKP.ipynb)

Here the analytic solution and 5 methods (numerical) for solving a differential equation is given.

Methods:
1. Symbolic solution
2. Using `odeint` (from `scipy.integrate`)
3. Using `solve_ivp` (from `scipy.integrate`)
4. Euler method
5. Modified Euler method
6. Runge - Kutta method

These methods are applied here to solve;
1. 1st Order ODE
2. 2nd Order ODE
3. 3rd Order ODE
4. 4th Order ODE

## Fourier Series [file](Fourier_Series_SKP.ipynb)

Code for getting Fourier series (both analytical and numerical) is given here.

- **Functions in `scipy.signal`** (waveforms, wavelets, peak finding)
- **Numerical Case**
- **Symbolic Case**


## Integral Transforms [file](Integral_Transforms_SKP.ipynb)

$$I(F(t)) = \int_0^x F(t) K(x,t) dt = f(x)$$
Where, $K(x,t)$ is called the kernel.

Code for analytic solution of Laplace transform is given here.
